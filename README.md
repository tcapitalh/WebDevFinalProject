# Hi there 👋 I'm Tracey
I'm a passionate Web Developer specializing in FrontEnd Development, with a keen eye for detail and a love for creating intuitive, dynamic, and responsive web applications using $\color{blue}{JavaScript}$. Welcome to my GitHub profile!
 
## 🚀 About Me
I've honed my skills in high-quality web solutions, particularly in JavaScript, through self-teaching and projects I've initiated. My curiosity about website building has evolved into a passion for bringing ideas to life on the web. I thrive on challenges and continually seek to learn new technologies to enhance my craft. My background in finance operations and communication enriches my ability to develop effective solutions, despite limited industry experience.

## 🌟 Featured Projects
TrackMove Project: Creating an app for cataloging personal items during a house move would involved: a $\color{blue}{database}$ for storing item information, descriptions, and photos; $\color{blue}{camera}$ $\color{blue}{integration}$ to allow users to take and upload photos of their items; an $\color{blue}{intuitive}$ $\color{blue}{UI}$ for entering, categorizing, and organizing items efficiently; $\color{blue}{search}$ $\color{blue}{functionality}$  for easy retrieval of items, and $\color{blue}{authentication}$ for secure login and user accounts. $\color{blue}{Cloud}$ $\color{blue}{storage}$ is important for backing up item data and photos, while $\color{blue}{offline}$ $\color{blue}{access}$ allows users to catalog items without an internet connection. $\color{blue}{Notifications}$ are used to remind users of upcoming tasks or deadlines.
 
Tech stack: To create the cataloging app, I used a $\color{blue}{MERN}$ stack. This includes $\color{blue}{MongoDB}$ for the database to store item information and photos, $\color{blue}{Express.js}$ as the web application framework, $\color{blue}{React}$ for building the user interface, and $\color{blue}{Node.js}$ as the server environment. Additionally, $\color{blue}{AWS}$ $\color{blue}{S3}$ for cloud storage, $\color{blue}{JWT}$ for secure authentication, and $\color{blue}{Redux}$ for state management ensured smooth functionality and seamless user experiences.
 
## 🌱 What I'm Learning
I'm continuously expanding my skill set and currently diving deeper into:
 
MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js, Redux, Jest for unit testing, and UI/UX design principles.
